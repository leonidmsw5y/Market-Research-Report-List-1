<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Railway Wheel-Sets Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Outboard Bearings Arrangement</li><li>Inboard Bearing Arrangement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The railway wheel-sets market is primarily categorized into two types based on bearing arrangements: outboard and inboard. Outboard bearing arrangements position the bearings outside the wheel frame, allowing easier maintenance and better alignment. Inboard bearing arrangements, however, place the bearings inside the wheel frame, offering advantages in weight distribution and overall design compactness. Both arrangements influence the durability, performance, and efficiency of the wheel-sets, catering to different operational needs within the railway industry.</p></p>
